           Naruto is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is told in two parts  the first set in Naruto's pre-teen years, and the second in his teens. The series is based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the following year, and Naruto (1997).

        A powerful fox known as the Nine-Tails attacks Konoha, the hidden leaf village in the Land of Fire, one of the Five Great Shinobi Countries in the Ninja World. In response, the leader of Konoha and the Fourth Hokage, Minato Namikaze seals the fox inside the body of his newborn son, Naruto Uzumaki, making Naruto a host of the beast; this costs Naruto's father his life, and the Third Hokage returns from retirement to become the leader of Konoha again. Naruto is often scorned by Konoha's villagers for being the host of the Nine-Tails. Due to a decree by the Third Hokage forbidding any mention of these events, Naruto learns nothing about the Nine-Tails until 12 years later, when Mizuki, a renegade ninja, reveals the truth to Naruto. Naruto then defeats Mizuki in combat, earning the respect of his teacher, Iruka Umino.</p><p>

        Shortly afterward, Naruto becomes a ninja and joins with Sasuke Uchiha, against whom he often competes, and Sakura Haruno, on whom he has a crush, to form Team 7, under an experienced sensei, the elite ninja Kakashi Hatake. Like all the ninja teams from every village, Team 7 completes missions requested by the villagers, ranging from doing chores and being bodyguards to performing assassinations.</p>

            Naruto Uzumaki (うずまき ナルト, Uzumaki Naruto) is the title character and main protagonist of the franchise. He was the first character created by Kishimoto during the conception of the series and was designed with many traits from other shōnen characters.[7] He is often shunned by the Konohagakure villagers, as he is the host of Kurama, the Nine-Tailed Fox that attacked Konoha.[ch. 2] He became a ninja after training hard in the Ninja Academy, learning ninjutsu and taijutsu skills, and compensates for this with his cheerful and boisterous personality as he developed his catchphrase "Believe it!" (～だってばよ, dattebayo), vowing to never give up on any goal he sets. In particular, Naruto has ambitions of becoming Hokage, the strongest ninja leader of Konohagakure, to gain the villagers' respect and be able to protect them. During a battle as a ninja, Naruto has mastered powerful various ninjutsu skills and abilities including the ability to create a massive and several clones of himself known as "Shadow Clone Jutsu", the ability to use his wind nature as he's able to master a powerful spiral chakra sphere known as the "Rasengan" for the purposes of the offense, and other numerous abilities like using Nine-Tailed Fox's chakra that increases his speed, strength, agility, and even whenever Naruto was enraged and goes feral but later in Part II he manage to control the Nine Tails' chakra. Over the course of the series, Naruto befriends many foreign and Konoha people and eventually claims a sizable positive impact on their lives, which grants him worldwide fame.[ch.. 450] Naruto eventually achieves his dream of becoming Hokage, marries Hinata Hyuga and has two children named Boruto Uzumaki and Himawari Uzumaki.[ch.. 700] Naruto is voiced by Junko Takeuchi in Japanese, and by Maile Flanagan in English.

            Sasuke Uchiha (うちは サスケ, Uchiha Sasuke) is Naruto's rival. He was designed by Kishimoto as the "cool genius" since he felt this was an integral part of an ideal rivalry.[1] Sasuke's older brother, Itachi Uchiha, killed the rest of their family.[ch. 224] Because of this, Sasuke's sole desire is to kill his brother, and he develops a cold and withdrawn personality, seeing people as tools to further his goals, although also gaining the affection of most of the girls he knows, much to his annoyance. After he becomes a member of Team 7, Sasuke seems to begin considering his teammates precious to the point of risking his life to protect them, while focusing on revenge less than at the start of the series. When during the battle, Sasuke is a taijutsu expert and has mastered his ability to manipulate numerous fire techniques including known as "Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu", manipulating a fury of lightning known as "Chidori" and as a member of the Uchiha clan, he uses the Sharingan that allows him to senses the opponent's moves and attacks. Following an encounter and a subsequent defeat at the hands of his brother in Part I, however, Sasuke severs his ties and leaves the village to seek more power from Orochimaru. By the events of the Boruto franchise, Sasuke has become a vigilante investigating the Otsutsuki clan for Konohagakure. Sasuke is voiced by Noriaki Sugiyama in the Japanese anime, while his English voice actor is Yuri Lowenthal.

            Sakura Haruno (春野 サクラ, Haruno Sakura) is a member of Team 7. While creating the character, Kishimoto has admitted that he had little perception of what an ideal girl should be like. As a child, Sakura was teased by other children because of her large forehead, a feature Kishimoto tried to emphasize in Sakura's appearance. She was comforted by Ino Yamanaka and the two developed a friendship. However, as the two grew, they became increasingly distant due to their shared affection for Sasuke Uchiha. As a kunoichi, Sakura possesses superier strength to unleash her powerful punch towards the opponents when she is enraged by saying "Cha!" (しゃーんなろー!, Shānnarō!) and as a medical ninja, she can heal every wounds whenever they are injured. During the early moments of Part I, Sakura is infatuated with Sasuke and resents Naruto Uzumaki, although Sasuke views her as "annoying" and Naruto has feelings for her. Her perception on Naruto eventually changes, however, and she comes to see him as a friend, while her feelings for Sasuke grow into deep love. In the Japanese anime, her voice actress is Chie Nakamura, and she is voiced by Kate Higgins in the English adaptation.
